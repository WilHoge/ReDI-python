If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, 
we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Hint: Look into the use of the modulo (%) operator if you are trying to solve
this by looping over all numbers (https://realpython.com/python-modulo-operator/#modulo-operator-with-int)

Hint: Another approach can you make use of range() and specific step sizes to also calculate the required sum. 
You can calculate the sum of a list of integers in Python using the built-in sum() function.

Maybe you can come up with a solution that makes use of the so-called 
inclusion-exclusion principle. For more info check the Wikipedia page
